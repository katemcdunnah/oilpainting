<h2>Underpainting</h2>
    <p>Creating an underpainting is one way to start an oil painting. It is the practice of using thinned oil paint and lightly painting the outline of whatever it is you will be painting;consider it as sketching, but with paint. Underpaintings are typically done with earthy tones, and color will not be added AT ALL until the underpainting is done. Once you have the basic outline, you can start minimally shading your painting (still using only earthy tones). Once the underpainting is complete, then you can add color.</p>

<h3>Transparency and Layering</h3>
    <p>Whenever you mix in paint thinner with the raw paints, the paints can become more transparent (depending on how much thinner you add). The process of layering is using the transparency of the paints to build up color. When you do this process, you will have more control of the darkness or lightness of the color, but it will take much longer.</p>
<h4>"Wet on Wet"</h4>
    <p>One main difference between oil paints and acrylic paints is the time the paint takes to dry. Acrylic paints dry rather quickly, whereas oil paints can take a long time to dry. Because oils take a while to dry, blending is much easier. The "wet on wet" technique is when you apply paint onto another layer of paint that hasn't fully dryed. Because the bottom layer is still wet, blending the two colors becomes a lot easier.</p>
<h5>Gel</h5>
    <p>Oil paints can take a while to dry, however, there are certain things that can be mixed in with the paint in order to make it dry faster. That's when gel comes in handy. If you pause painting and take a break, the bottom layer of paint will be relatively dry. You can mix in gel with your paint to make help blend the semi-dry bottom layer with the layer you are about to put on. Gel can also be mixed in with the paint to make a semi-glossy sheen on your painting.</p>
